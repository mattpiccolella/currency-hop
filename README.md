# Flask Skeleton Project
This is a skeleton for a Flask application. It allows for very fast upstart when wanting to write Flask applications, and works with Vagrant, Virtualenv, and Gunicorn to make both development and production easy.

## Steps
```
$ git clone https://github.com/mjp2220/flask-skeleton .
$ vagrant up
$ virtualenv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
